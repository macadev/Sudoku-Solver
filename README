Sudoku puzzle solving algorithm. Implements a backtracking approach where the most constrained cells in the puzzle (the oneâ€™s with the least number of possibilities) are targeted first for possible placements. If the program reaches a dead-end, a cell with no possible placements, then last move is undone an alternative option is attempted.

Tested on sudoku grids of size 20x20, solving time was always under 10 seconds.
